This first vector is the prediction measurements between one particular
particle and all of the map landmarks within sensor range.

The first thing you'll need to do here is to predict measurements to all the
map landmarks within sensor range for each particle.

This function will perform nearest neighbor data association and assign
each sensor observation the map landmark ID associated with it.

Once you have these predicted landmark measurements, you can use the data
association function you've implemented to associate the sensor measurements
to map landmarks.
You'll need these associations to calculate the new weight of each particle
by using the multivariate Gaussian probability density function
Finally, you'll have to normalize these weights so that they'll be in range
0 to 1.
